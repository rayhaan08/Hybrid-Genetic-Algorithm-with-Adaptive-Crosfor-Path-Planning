# Hybrid-Genetic-Algorithm-with-Adaptive-Crossover-for-Path-Planning
A new adaptive crossover method is proposed to solve the Multi Travelling Salesman Problem (mTSP) using real parameter Genetic Algorithm, to minimize the longest tour. The crossover operator used is dynamically changed with respect to the spread of the distances travelled by each salesman. A two-part chromosome is used to represent each candidate solution and crossover method is designed for the same.

# Instruction:
The code has been written to solve the Berlin 52 problem for multiple salesmen.
To get the results, run the function main;
where, m=the no of salesmen to solve for;
runs=number of runs to perform

The function call will return 2 variables, the optimum longest tour and the the optimum route in two-part chromosome form.
